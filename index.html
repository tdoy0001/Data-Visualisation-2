        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Australia is one of the leading wine-producing countries in the world, known for its high-quality wines and
          diverse wine regions. Its wine industry is a significant part of the country's agricultural and export
          sectors, with wines being sold domestically and internationally.
        </p>
        <h3>Wine Regions</h3>
        <p>Australia boasts over 60 designated wine regions, each with its unique climate and soil, contributing to the
          diversity of wines produced.
          <br><br>
          South Australia and New South Wales are known for their warmer climate varieties such as Shiraz and Cabernet
          Sauvignon, whereas Victoria is known for cool climate-loving Pinot Noir.
          <br><br>
          Major wine regions include Barossa Valley in South Australia, Hunter Valley in New
          South Wales, and Margaret River in Western Australia.

          In Australia, the move toward French wine varieties has been dramatic. This is because varieties known for
          producing premium still and sparkling wines are now preferred over those traditionally used for fortified
          wines.
          <br><br>
          Producers are well aware of the impact climate changes are having on the quality their winegrapes and on
          vineyard yields and production costs.
          <br><br>
          Adaptation strategies include switching to warmer-climate or more-resilient grape varieties, and re-locating
          to a region at a higher latitude or elevation to retain the current mix of grape varieties in their portfolio.

          Major grape varieties are Shiraz, Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc,
          SÃ©millon, and Riesling.
          <br><br>
          The most widely cultivated grape variety in Australia is Shiraz, known for high levels of tannins and notes of
          blackberry, mint and black pepper.
          <br><br>
          Chardonnay wine tends to be medium to light body with noticeable acidity and flavors of green plum, apple, and pear. In warmer locations like Adelaide Hills and Mornington Peninsula, the flavors become more citrus, peach, and melon.

        <h3>Consumption</h3>
        <p>
          Apparent consumption of alcohol refers to the total amount of alcohol produced or imported
          that will be sold to people living in Australia.
          <br><br>
          Per capita wine consumption remains at one of the highest levels in the last 60 years, and accounted for 42%
          of the total apparent alcohol consumption, making it the largest category.
          <br><br>
          Beer consumption continued its long-standing decline, dropping to 3.5 litres of
          pure alcohol consumed per person in 2020, marking the lowest level since the 1940s.
          <br><br>
          Spirits saw a 19% increase in availability from 1.8 litres of alcohol per capita in 2017 to 2.1 litres in
          2020.
          <br><br>
          Cider continues to make up a small portion of the total amount of alcohol made available in Australia.
